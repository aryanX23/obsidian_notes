### What is Virtualization ?

**Virtualization** is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources".
In other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.

#### What is the concept behind the Virtualization?

Creation of a virtual machine over existing operating system and hardware is known as Hardware Virtualization. A Virtual machine provides an environment that is logically separated from the underlying hardware.

The machine on which the virtual machine is going to create is known as **Host Machine** and that virtual machine is referred as a **Guest Machine**

#### Types of Virtualization:

1. Hardware Virtualization:
When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager _(VMM) is directly installed on the hardware system_ is known as hardware virtualization.

The main job of hypervisor is to control and monitoring the processor, memory and other hardware resources.
After virtualization of hardware system we can install different operating system on it and run different applications on those OS.

**Usage:**
Hardware virtualization is mainly done for the server platforms, because controlling virtual machines is much easier than controlling a physical server.

2. Operating System Virtualization:
When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager _(VMM) is installed on the Host operating system_ instead of directly on the hardware system is known as operating system virtualization.

**Usage:**
Operating System Virtualization is mainly used for testing the applications on different platforms of OS.

3. Server Virtualization:
When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager _(VMM) is directly installed on the Server system is known as server virtualization.

**Usage:**
Server virtualization is done because a single physical server can be divided into multiple servers on the demand basis and for balancing the load.

4.  Storage Virtualization:
Storage virtualization is the _process of grouping the physical storage from multiple network storage devices so that it looks like a single storage device_.

Storage virtualization is also implemented by using software applications.

**Usage:**
Storage virtualization is mainly done for back-up and recovery purposes.

### Types of Cloud Computing - 

	Cloud computing is usually described in one of the two ways.Either based in the deployment model or on the service that the cloud is offering.

#### Based on the service models, the list is as follows -
1. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

##### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) -

[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-iaas-paas-and-saas/) helps in delivering computer infrastructure on an external basis for supporting operations. Generally, IaaS provides services to networking equipment, devices, databases, and web servers.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) helps large organizations, and large enterprises in managing and building their IT platforms. This infrastructure is flexible according to the needs of the client.

**Advantages of IaaS

- IaaS is cost-effective as it eliminates capital expenses.
- IaaS cloud provider provides better security than any other software.
- IaaS provides remote access.

**Disadvantages of IaaS

- In IaaS, users have to secure their own data and applications.
- Cloud computing is not accessible in some regions of the World.

---
##### Platform as a service (PaaS) -

[Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/platform-as-a-service-paas-and-its-types/) is a type of cloud computing that helps developers to build applications and services over the Internet by providing them with a platform.

PaaS helps in maintaining control over their business applications.

**Advantages of PaaS

- PaaS is simple and very much convenient for the user as it can be accessed via a web browser.
- PaaS has the capabilities to efficiently manage the lifecycle.

**Disadvantages of PaaS

- PaaS has limited control over infrastructure as they have less control over the environment and are not able to make some customizations.
- PaaS has a high dependence on the provider.

---
##### Software as a service (SaaS) -

[Software as a Service (SaaS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-as-a-service-saas/) is a type of cloud computing model that is the work of delivering services and applications over the Internet. The SaaS applications are called Web-Based Software or Hosted Software.

SaaS has around 60 percent of cloud solutions and due to this, it is mostly preferred by companies.

**Advantages of SaaS

- SaaS can access app data from anywhere on the Internet.
- SaaS provides easy access to features and services.

**Disadvantages of SaaS

- SaaS solutions have limited customization, which means they have some restrictions within the platform.
- SaaS has little control over the data of the user.
- SaaS are generally cloud-based, they require a stable internet connection for proper working.

#### Based on Deployment models, the list is as follows -

##### **Public Cloud** - 
The public cloud makes it possible for anybody to access systems and services. The public cloud may be less secure as it is open to everyone. The public cloud is one in which cloud infrastructure services are provided over the internet to the general people or major industry groups. The infrastructure in this cloud model is owned by the entity that delivers the cloud services, not by the consumer. It is a type of cloud hosting that allows customers and users to easily access systems and services. This form of cloud computing is an excellent example of cloud hosting, in which service providers supply services to a variety of customers. In this arrangement, storage backup and retrieval services are given for free, as a subscription, or on a per-user basis. For example, Google App Engine etc.

![Public Cloud](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211123123729/Group4-660x330.jpg)

 **Advantages of the Public Cloud Model**

- **Minimal Investment:** Because it is a pay-per-use service, there is no substantial upfront fee, making it excellent for enterprises that require immediate access to resources.
- **No setup cost:** The entire infrastructure is fully subsidized by the cloud service providers, thus there is no need to set up any hardware.
- **Infrastructure Management is not required:** Using the public cloud does not necessitate infrastructure management.
- **No maintenance:** The maintenance work is done by the service provider (not users).
- **Dynamic Scalability:** To fulfill your company’s needs, on-demand resources are accessible. 

**Disadvantages of the Public Cloud Model**

- **Less secure:** Public cloud is less secure as resources are public so there is no guarantee of high-level security.
- **Low customization:** It is accessed by many public so it can’t be customized according to personal requirements.

##### **Private Cloud** -

The private cloud deployment model is the exact opposite of the public cloud deployment model. It’s a one-on-one environment for a single user (customer). There is no need to share your hardware with anyone else. The distinction between [private and public clouds](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-public-cloud-and-private-cloud/) is in how you handle all of the hardware. It is also called the “internal cloud” & it refers to the ability to access systems and services within a given border or organization. The cloud platform is implemented in a cloud-based secure environment that is protected by powerful firewalls and under the supervision of an organization’s IT department. The private cloud gives greater flexibility of control over cloud resources.

![Private Cloud](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211123123851/Group1-660x330.jpg)


**Advantages of the Private Cloud Model**

- **Better Control:** You are the sole owner of the property. You gain complete command over service integration, IT operations, policies, and user behavior. 
- **Data Security and Privacy:** It’s suitable for storing corporate information to which only authorized staff have access. By segmenting resources within the same infrastructure, improved access and security can be achieved.
- **Supports Legacy Systems:** This approach is designed to work with legacy systems that are unable to access the public cloud. 
- **Customization:** Unlike a public cloud deployment, a private cloud allows a company to tailor its solution to meet its specific needs.

 **Disadvantages of the Private Cloud Model**

- **Less scalable:** Private clouds are scaled within a certain range as there is less number of clients.
- **Costly:** Private clouds are more costly as they provide personalized facilities.

---

##### **Hybrid Cloud** -

By bridging the public and private worlds with a layer of proprietary software, hybrid cloud computing gives the best of both worlds. With a hybrid solution, you may host the app in a safe environment while taking advantage of the public cloud’s cost savings. Organizations can move data and applications between different clouds using a combination of two or more cloud deployment methods, depending on their needs. 

![Hybrid Cloud](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211123123930/Group2-660x330.jpg)


**Advantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model**

- **Flexibility and control:** Businesses with more flexibility can design personalized solutions that meet their particular needs.
- **Cost:** Because public clouds provide scalability, you’ll only be responsible for paying for the extra capacity if you require it.
- **Security:** Because data is properly separated, the chances of data theft by attackers are considerably reduced. 

**Disadvantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model**

- **Difficult to manage:** Hybrid clouds are difficult to manage as it is a combination of both public and private cloud. So, it is complex.
- **Slow data transmission:** Data transmission in the hybrid cloud takes place through the public cloud so latency occurs.

---

##### **Community Cloud** - 

It allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations. It is a distributed system that is created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of a community, industry, or business. The infrastructure of the community could be shared between the organization which has shared concerns or tasks. It is generally managed by a third party or by the combination of one or more organizations in the community. 

![Community Cloud](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211123124006/Group3-660x330.jpg)


**Advantages of the Community Cloud Model**

- **Cost Effective:** It is cost-effective because the cloud is shared by multiple organizations or communities.
- **Security:** Community cloud provides better security.
- **Shared resources:** It allows you to share resources, infrastructure, etc. with multiple organizations.
- **Collaboration and data sharing:** It is suitable for both collaboration and data sharing.

**Disadvantages of the Community Cloud Model**

- **Limited Scalability:** Community cloud is relatively less scalable as many organizations share the same resources according to their collaborative interests. 
- **Rigid in customization:** As the data and resources are shared among different organizations according to their mutual interests if an organization wants some changes according to their needs they cannot do so because it will have an impact on other organizations.

##### **Multi-Cloud** -

We’re talking about employing [multiple cloud providers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-multi-cloud/) at the same time under this paradigm, as the name implies. It’s similar to the hybrid cloud deployment approach, which combines public and private cloud resources. Instead of merging private and public clouds, multi-cloud uses many public clouds. Although public cloud providers provide numerous tools to improve the reliability of their services, mishaps still occur. It’s quite rare that two distinct clouds would have an incident at the same moment. As a result, multi-cloud deployment improves the high availability of your services even more. 

![Multi-Cloud](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230425095022/multicloud.webp)


**Advantages of the Multi-Cloud Model**

- You can mix and match the best features of each cloud provider’s services to suit the demands of your apps, workloads, and business by choosing different cloud providers. 
- **Reduced Latency:** To reduce latency and improve user experience, you can choose cloud regions and zones that are close to your clients. 
- **High availability of service:** It’s quite rare that two distinct clouds would have an incident at the same moment. So, the multi-cloud deployment improves the high availability of your services. 

**Disadvantages of the Multi-Cloud Model**

- **Complex:** The combination of many clouds makes the system complex and bottlenecks may occur.
- **Security issue:** Due to the complex structure, there may be loopholes to which a hacker can take advantage hence, makes the data insecure.
