## Why Blockchain ?
	Trust Machine
- As government and business are increasingly becoming digital, the need for *trust, data integrity, and verifiability* has become imperative.
- Blockchain is promising due to its features of consensus driven distributed ledger maintained by a *distributed network of computing systems.*
- This has created an exciting possibility of *Data Permanence, Immutability and Authenticity* enabling transactions in a trust-less business scenarios and new business.

## What is Blockchain ?
	Also called Internet of Value

- Blockchain is a *Distributed Ledger* governed by a peer to peer network.
- In simple terms, it is a distributed data base which is accessible and visible to all the stakeholders involved to have a *trusted and transparent data sharing and information symmetry.*
- Just as today's internet let us freely share information, blockchain lets us freely share value.
- Through Blockchain initially transformed Fin-Tech space, Non Fin-Tech space also caught up with Blockchain use cases for example - Police FIR Records, Forensic Data, where, intermediaries cannot be trusted.
- If Blockchain is being used to store such data, once the data is being stored to ledger, it is *impossible to tamper with the data.*
- Data integrity is the value proposition of Blockchain. Any data on Blockchain is thus immutable and *cannot be modified/manipulated.*
- Blockchain is a multidisciplinary field which deals with concepts of *cryptography, game theory, and distributed computing*.
- Transactions on Blockchain are pooled as *Blocks* and Blocks are chained together with *Hash Pointers.*
- Transactions can be triggered by a *smart contract*, a self executable business logic.

## Backend of Blockchain :
	Centralized vs Distributed vs Decentralized

- Lets take Centralized IT systems which are mostly used in enterprises like Oracle. All these ERP applications which we typically hear are using this centralized IT infrastructure.Here we have one main server and the application is connected to this server. The user request will go the server back and forth. All the user data is managed on this server.
- In a Distributed network topology, there is a central server called a as master server and we have some servers called as sub-nodes and whenever there are some user request, all these user request will be going to these sub-nodes. These Sub-nodes will be processing those transaction or user requests and, at a certain frequency, all the data with this sub-node is reconciled with the main server or the master server and only when data goes back the master server, only then the processing is complete.
- In Decentralized architecture, there is no master server. All the servers are equal and will process all the user requests and they all will maintain the same copy of data. That is why all the nodes in the above figure are connected with one other. Its a peer to peer network. No one governs this network that is, there is no human administrator governing this network. A Protocol manages this network and this protocol has all the rules required for all the nodes to follow.

### Advantages of Decentralized Servers:

- In Centralized and Distributed Servers, since only one server is managing all the data, if this server gets compromised, all the data is susceptible to change or damage and there is no way to get the data back without backup. There is only single point of failure that is the master server.
- In Decentralized servers, as all the node in the network maintain same copy of data, even if a hacker attacks one of the node and manipulates data in it, other node knows the true data or the truth, the manipulation that is happening will be rejected. If a successful attack is to be planned, one needs to attack atleast 51% of the nodes.
- If majority of the nodes are attacked, it is possible to manipulate the data but, its very tough to do so as compared to centralized and distributed systems.
- For example if one wants to attack a Bitcoin network, one need to attack 51000 nodes+ in a 10 minute time, which is the typical block time of the Bitcoin network.
- Another Example is, if one wants to attack a Ethereum network, we need to attack 15000+ nodes within 2 seconds which is the typical block time of this network otherwise, any change will be rejected immediately.

## Data Structures of Blockchain:

![[Pasted image 20230218171019.png]]

- Blockchain follows a Distributed Ledger as the base data Structure type.
- If we take an example of back account, whatever transaction we are doing, the bank is only maintaining the data and the database, and thus this type of database is centralized and, only the bank can access the data and no one else.
- On the other hand, in a Decentralized network, the copy of a a data is maintained across n number of nodes which are connected to each other in a peer to peer fashion. When a transaction is performed, the Block of data is added by all the nodes in the network in a particular time slot and thus all the transactions are pooled as Blocks and all the Blocks are chronologically connected with each other.
