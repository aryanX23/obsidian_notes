# What is DART Programming Language: 

- Dart is the open-source programming language originally developed by Google. It is meant for both server side as well as the user side. The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the **Dart VM** and a utility dart2js which is meant for generating **Javascript equivalent of a Dart Script** so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart.
- Dart is **Object-oriented language** and is quite similar to that of [**Java Programming**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/). Dart is extensively use to create single-page websites and web-applications. Best **example** of dart application is **Gmail**.
-  You can install Dart SDK from their official [website](https://dart.dev/tools/sdk/archive) or download the installer from this [site](https://gekorm.com/dart-windows/).
