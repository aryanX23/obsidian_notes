# Motivations for Development :

- Bitcoin scripting language is *Turing Incomplete*.
- We can't do much complex complex tasks with Bitcoin's script.
- Due to inherit limitation of Bitcoins script, its usage is mostly restricted to value transfer only.

# What is Ethereum?
- A Decentralized p2p network to run smart contracts(software).
- Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013.
- Ethereum is a distributed state machine (a global computer) with no single point of control.
- Allows anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions

# Ethereum Currency :

- Ethereum Network has its own built in native Currency called ether.
- Allows efficient exchange between various typesd of digital assets
- Provides a mechanism for paying transaction fees
	- *wei* is the smallest unit
	- 10^18 wei is equal to 1 Ether

## Ethereum as State Transition Machine :

![[Pasted image 20230318184446.png]]

# Ethereum Components:

- World State
- Accounts
- Transactions
- Messages
- Gas and Fees

## World State :

![[Pasted image 20230318185322.png]]
	Every Account State has different address
![[Pasted image 20230318185450.png]]
- Account state consists of the following parts - 
	- Nonce - States how many transactions the account has done. No transactions means value of nonce is 0.
	- Balance - Self Explainatory
	- Storage Hash - If it a contract address then it has hash of whatever is the storage inside the smart contract.
	- Code Hash- Hash of the code of the smart contract.

## Accounts: 

There exists two types of accounts - 
![[Pasted image 20230318190551.png]]

> The Externally owned account (EOA) is controlled by whomsoever has the private key to it.This private key is used to generate public key by using a Eliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Then a Hash Value is generated of 256 bits from which only the right 160 bits is taken as address.
![[Pasted image 20230318192142.png]]

> Now in case of Contract Accounts, the sender's address and the Nonce is concatenated and the hash value is calculated using the same hashing algorithm used in above example which gives 256 bits hash.Then the right 160 bits are taken to calculate the address.

` Note - ` 0X is added to the left of the hexadecimal address to create the final address eg - 0X123ABC

## Transaction - 

The term *transaction* is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account.

![[Pasted image 20230318193709.png]]

 - Gas Price - The amount of price one has to pay for each successful transaction.
 - Gas Limit - The maximum gas we want to use.
 - Value - The amount being transfered
 - v,r,s - The signature value
 - init - contract creation
 - data - message call

### Two Types of Transactions - 

1. Contract Creation -  
![[Pasted image 20230318194645.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230318200527.png]]

- Constants and state variable are stored inside the code container.
- The init code will have all the fields that are there in the general transaction fields except the to field.

2. Message call - Transfer of ether from one account to another.
![[Pasted image 20230318194702.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230318201236.png]]
- Here the to field is included as the message is to be passed from one account to another account and the destination accounts address is mentioned in the input data.

## What is a Message? 

![[Pasted image 20230318201605.png]]

## Gas and Fees: 
- Gas is the smallest computational unit in Ethereum.
- All programmable computation in Ethereum is subject to fees (denominated in gas).
- Eg. - To transfer any amount of ETH from one account to another, 21000 GAS is utilized.
- ![[Pasted image 20230318202032.png]]
- Now, the Gas price is dependent upon the congestion in the network; if the congestion in the network is low then the gas price is low and vice versa.

# Ethereum Ecosystem - 

![[Pasted image 20230318202851.png]]

- Ethereum itself is not sufficient to build full-fledged, decentralized applications and thus we require some more technologies -

## SWARM :

> Decentralized File Systems

- Distributed Storage Platform and Content distribution Service
	- Fault Tolerant
	- Censorship resistant
	- DDos Resistant
	- Zero Downtime

## WHISPER :

> Secure Messaging Protocol for DApps

- Privacy
- Anonymity

# Ethereum Wallet :

* Ethereum wallets are applications that allows
users to interact with their Ethereum accounts
* They are controlled through a Private Key
	- Allow users read balance, send transactions and connect to applications
	- An app for managing your funds
	- lets you connect to any DApp using your Ethereum account.

## Types of Wallets - 

![[Pasted image 20230319004918.png]]
eg of a web wallet - 
	Metamask-
![[Pasted image 20230319005100.png]]

# Smart Contracts :

- Smart Contracts is a piece of code which is stored in the blockchain network (on each participant database)
- It defines the conditions on which all parties using the contract can be executed if the required conditions are met.
- Ether is the currency to pay for your contract to be executed on the blockchain.

## Smart Contract Benefits: 

- Autonomy
- Trust
- Speed
- Backup
- Savings
- Accuracy

## Ethereum Smart Contract Application Areas:

- Suppy Chain Management
- Identity Manegement (Passport, E-Residency, Birth Certificates and Wedding Certificates, Online Account Logins , etc)
- Financial Services (Trade processing and settlement, Loan Origination and Servicing, Record Keeping processes, Auditing and Corporate Compliance Shareholder Voting, Reducing Counterparty risk, Cross-Border Payments and more)
- IoT
ETC....
