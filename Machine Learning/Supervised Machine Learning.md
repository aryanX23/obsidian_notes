# Supervised Learning: 
 
- Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.
-  The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from.
-  That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output.
-  Example of how supervised learning algorithms are used in *real life scenarios*.
- Basically, Supervised learning learns from the data labeled with the *right answers*.

## Major types of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms:

### Regression based learning:
[[Linear Regression Model]]
Predicts a number form infinitely many possible outputs through the use of linear and non-linear regression.

e.g. 1-

e.g. 2-

### Classification based Learning:

- Classification predicts  categories from a given number of possible inputs based on the classification training.
e.g.
> Breast Cancer Detection System:
![[Classification_Ex1.png|900x500]]

- In the above given image, our machine learning algorithm detects the type of cancer by using the tumor size input.

- In the above given image we are having multiple inputs that help us to detect the cancer type, the inputs include Age, Tumor size, etc.
By using these inputs our algorithm classifies the above tumors into different categories.
