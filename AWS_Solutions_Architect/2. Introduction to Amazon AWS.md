# Introduction to AWS :

- AWS began its offering of IT infrastructure in 2006 in the form of web services ie. now commonly known as cloud computing.
- AWS serves over a million active customers in more than 190 countries.

## Regions and Availability :

- The AWS cloud infrastructure is built around AWS regions and Availability zones.
- Region is geographic area and is a cluster of data centers.
- Each region has multiple isolated locations known as availability zones.
- Availability zones consists of one or more discrete data centers.
- As of now AWS spans 31 regions and 99 availability zones.
	- A Local Zone is an AWS infrastructure deployment that places selected services closer to your end users. 
	- Each AWS Local Zone location is an extension of an extension of an AWS Region that is in a different location from your Region.
	- Most AWS Services are Region-scoped, ie - Some Services Available in a region might not be available in another region.
	
### How to Chose Optimal Region :

- **Compliance Factor:** Compliance with data governance and legal requirements must be kept in mind before deploying a service in aws region, ie - if the data being stored by the application is region sensitive and should remain in that region.
- **Proximity Factor :** The closer the service is deployed to customers, the lesser is the round trip time between users and the services, hence lesser latency.
- **Available Services per Region  :** Some Services being used by a service might not be present in newer regions, so for choosing regions, this should be kept in mind.
- **Pricing Factor :** Pricing Varies from region to region hence, it should be kept in mind before deploying a service in a particular region.

### Brief About AWS Availability Zones :

- Each Region can have many Availability Zones(usually 3, min - 3, max - 6)
  For Example - 
	- ap-southeast-1
	- ap-southeast-2
	- ap-southeast-3
- Each Availability Zone (Abbreviated as AZ) is one or more discreet data centers physically separated from each other with redundant power supply, networking and connectivity.
- They are separated from each other so they can be isolated from disasters.
- They are connected with other using high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.

## AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations): 

- Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400 + Edge Locations & 10+ Region Caches) in 90+ Cities and 40+ Countries.
- This enables content being delivered to end users with low latency.

## Security -

- The AWS cloud enables a shared responsibility model. While AWS manages security of the cloud, you are responsible for security in the cloud.
- The Provider must ensure that their infrastructure is secure, while the user must take measures to fortify their application and strong passwords and authentication measures.

## Benefits of AWS Security - 

- Keep your data safe.
- Meet your compliance requirements.
- Save Money.
- Scale Quickly.

--- 
## AWS Cloud Platform - 

AWS consists of  many cloud services that you can use in combinations tailored to your business or organisational needs.
To access the services , you can use :

## Services Provided by AWS -

Majorly they are of two types -> 

### Globally Available Services OR Global Services:
- [[Identity and Access Management (IAM)]]
### Region Specific Services: 
1. [[Amazon EC2(Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)]]
2.
