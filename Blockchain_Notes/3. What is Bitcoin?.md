# What is BitCoin? 

- Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem.
- Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet.
- Users of bitcoin own keys which allow them to prove owner-ship of transactions.
- Bitcoin is a fully- distributed , peer to peer system which is a type of public blockchain. As such there is no central server or point of control.
- Bitcoins are created through a process calles mining.
- People maintaining a node are called as miner and people just using it for transaction are called users.
- Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21 million bitcoin ie- after the limit has been reached, no more coins can be mined.

# Challenges involved in using bits as money?

1. Can I trust the money is authentic and not counterfeit?
2. Can I be sure that no one else can claim that this money belong to them and not me?( aka the *double-spend problem*)

## How paper money address these challenges? 

- Issuers of paper money uses increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technologies.
- Physical money addresses the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two places at once.
- Central Authorities to audit and clear all electronic transactions.

## Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System  - 

> Bitcoin represent the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four keys innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination.  

Bitcoin consists of :
1. A decentralized peer to peer network(the bitcoin protocol).
2. A Public transaction ledger ( the blockchain ).
3. A de-centralized transaction verification system.(transaction script)

### How is it different from fiat currencies? 

- Decentralized
- Limited supply (Bitcoin's total circulating will only ever reach a figure slightly under 21 million coins by 2140)
- Pseudonymity
- Immutability
- Divisibility

`Example of a Typical Blockchain Wallet: 
![[Pasted image 20230318115930.png]]

- Every Public Blockchain will have a transaction explorer - Here you can go and check the transaction status.
- All the transactions happening in the world by anyone can be viewed by anyone. Pseudononimity is maintained as the address field of a user is just 26-35 hexadecimal characters.

### The UTXO Model: 

- The building blocks of a bitcoin transaction is an *unspent transaction output* or **UTXO**.
- UTXO are invisible chunks of bitcoin currency locked to a specific user, recorded on the blockchain and recognized as currency units by the entire network.
- There are no account or balances in bitcoin, there are only *unspent transaction outputs(UTXO)* scattered in the blockchain.
- The wallet calculates the user's balance by scanning the blockchain and aggregating all UTXO belonging to that user.
- The UTXO consumed by a transaction are called transaction inputs.

### How are transactions validated?
