# Step 1: Transactions and Contracts -

## Financial System is driven by Transactions and Contracts -

- Contracts, transactions and the records of them are among the defining structures in our economical, legal and the political systems.
- They protects assets and set organizational boundaries.
- They eshtablish and verify identities and chronological events.
- They govern interactions among nations, organizations, communities and individuals.

# Step 2: Ledgers and Records -

## Ledger - A record keeping system of transactions

- A ledger is the principal book or computer file for recording and totaling economical transactions measured in terms of a monetary unit.
- Ledger is a database type which supports only create and read operations.
- A Ledger is usually under the governance of financial intitutions like banks or enterprises in a centralized IT system.
- Data on a centralized system is vulnerable to a single point of attack.

# Step 3: Decentralized Peer to Peer Network -

## Centralized to Decentralized System

- In a digital world, the way we regulate and maintain administrative control has to change.
- Blockchain is distributed database.
- Each party on a blockchain has access to the entire database and its complete history. 
- No single party controls the data or the information.
- Every party can verify the records of its transaction partners directly without an intermediary.

# Step 4: Distributed Ledgers - Transactions as Blocks -

- Each party/peer maintains a node in the network.
- Each node gets an opportunity to validate and create blocks of transactions for a specific time slot.
- Once blocks gets created, it will be broadcasted to all the other peers in the network.
- Each node on the blockchain will validate the block and update in their local copy of ledger.

# Step 5: Crytographically Chained Blocks -

## Blocks are cryptographically chained together 

- Cryptography is a field of mathermatics which uses randomization to convert text in to unreadable hexadecimal number.
- Hashing is a cryptographic technique which converts data in a irreversible, fixed length random unreadable hexadecimal number.
- Any little change in original data brings drastic change in hash value.
- Each block gets a unique hash value and all blocks are mapped using hash pointers.
- Examples of change in blocks leading to the node being orphanized is given below -

>This image shows two legitimate blocks. Now, in the next image the currency filed of the first block will be changed from $10 to $100

> As we can see here, due to a small change in the information, the entire hash pointer of and after the current block became corrupted which will lead to disconnection of the block from the chain since it no longer can we accessed due to change of pointer info.

# Step 6: Consensus and Incentive Mechanism -

## Consensus is the Heart of Blockchain Network

- All nodes in the network comes to consensus to create and add blocks.
- Each blockchain network has a consensus mechanism based on the unit of value it is dealing with.
- Public blockchains which are governed by individuals or groups solve a problem to decide, who should add next block.
- Every puzzle solved fetches a reward an incentive to maintain node in a public network.
- Private blockachain which are governed by consortium of organizations use proof of stake and many other mechanisms.

# Step 7: Immutable Data -

## Data on Blockchain is immuatable

- Data integrity is one of the value proposition of blockchain.
- As ledger of all transactions and its digital footprint is across all peers in the network. Blockchain is tough to be hacked.
- As size of the network grows the Blockchain becomes more robust.
- Blockchain data is fool proof until 51% of the network is truthful.

# Step 8: Smart Contracts -

## Smart Contracts - Business Logic Codified 

- Every business transaction has a contractual agreement and business logic defined.
- Blockchain facilitates creation of smart contracts, which is a self executable program with business logic defined.
- Blockchain revolves around automation, each and every operation is a script and is executed when triggered by client application.

# Step 9: Trust and Transperency -

## Blockchain enables transactions in a trustless world

- Every transaction is visible to every peer/party involved.
- Data on blockchain is trusted due to property of immutability.
- Transaction data is transparent and is stored with time stamp for easy auditability.
- Trust and Transperency are need of the hour and Blockchain is an idea whose idea has come.
