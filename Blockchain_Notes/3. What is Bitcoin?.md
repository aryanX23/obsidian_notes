# Challenges involved in using bits as money?

1. Can I trust the money is authentic and not counterfeit?
2. Can I be sure that no one else can claim that this money belong to them and not me?( aka the *double-spend problem*)

## How paper money address these challenges? 

- Issuers of paper money uses increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technologies.
- Physical money addresses the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two places at once.
- Central Authorities to audit and clear all electronic transactions.

2. A Public transaction ledger ( the blockchain ).
3. A de-centralized transaction verification system.(transaction script)
