# EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) :

## What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 is a cloud computing platform that can be auto-scaled to to meet demand.

Different hardware and software configurations can be selected. Different geographical locations can be selected be closer to users, as well as providing redundancy in case of failures.

Persistent storage can be provided by Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage). [Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_aws_s3.asp) data can also be accessed with Amazon EC2 instances, and is free if they are in the same region.

## Amazon EC2 Pricing - 

Amazon EC2 instances are priced per second according to five different options:

- On-demand
- Spot instances (discounted short-term capacity if available)
- Savings Plans (commitment to a certain amount of usage)
- Reserved Instances (discounted reserved long-term capacity)
- Dedicated Hosts (on-demand hourly or by reserved instances)

----

## Features of EC2 -

- Virtual Computing Environment known as instances.
- Preconfigured templates for your instance know as AMI(Amazon Machine Image).
- Various configuration of CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity in instance type.
- Secure login information for your instance using keypairs.
- Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when hardware fails or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes.
- Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Storage(Amazon EBS), known as [[4. Elastic Block Storage (AMAZON EBS)]] .
- A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instance using security groups.
- Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources.

## What is an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and its Lifecycle -

- An Amazon Machine Image is a template that contains Software Configurations(like operating system, an application server and applications)

**LifeCycle of an AMI :**

![[Pasted image 20230613104745.png|1000]]

- Amazon EC2 enables you to share your AMIs with other AWS accounts.
- You can allow all AWS accounts to launch the AMI(make the AMI Public) or only allow a few specific accounts to launch the AMI.
- AMIs are a regional resource. Therefore, sharing an AMI makes it available to that region. To make an AMI available in a different region, copy the AMI to the region and then share it,

## Instance Types:

- When you launch an instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance.
- Some of the available Instance families are as follows :
	- General Purpose
	- Compute Optimized
	- Memory Optimized
	- Storage Optimized 
	- Accelerated Computing
	- HPC Optimized

There are current generation and previous generation instance types under the instance families, AWS recommend to move to current generation instance types for best performance but AWS still supports the previous generation types.

### Finding a Right Instance Type:

Before you launch an instance, you must select an instance type to use. The instance that you choose can differ depending on the requirements for the instances that you'll launch. For example you might want to consider the following requirements:
- Region
- The architecture: 32 bit(i386), 64bit(x86_64), or 64bit ARM(arm64)
- Compute
- Memory
- Storage
- Network performance

### Instance Purchasing Options:

Amazon EC2 provides the following purchasing options to enable you to optimize your costs based on your needs -

- On-Demand Instances : Pay, by the second, for the instances that you launch.
- Reserved instances : Reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent instance configuration, including instance type and Region, for a term of 1 or 3 years.
- EC2 Savings Plan : You can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent amaount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years.
- Spot Instances : Request unused EC2 instances, which can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs significantly.

### Instance Tenancy:

- Shared(default) - Multiple AWS Accounts may share the same physical hardware.
- Dedicated Instance(dedicated) - Your instance runs on a single tenant hardware. However, dedicated Instances might share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated instances.
- Dedicated Host(host) - Your instance runs on a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use, an isolated server with configurations that you can control. Dedicated Hosts allows you to use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, SUSE and Linuz Enterprise servers.

### Instance Lifecycle:

- The lifecycle of an instance starts when it is launched and ends when it is terminated. The purchasing
option that you choose affects the lifecycle of the instance.

#### Stop and Start Your Instance - 

	 You can only stop an Amazon EBS-backed instance. When you stop a running instance, the following happens - 

- The instance performs a normal shutdown and stops running; its status changes to stopping and then stopped.
- Any Amazon EBS volumes remain attached to the instance, and their data persists.
- Any data stored in the RAM of the host computer or the instance store volumes of the host computer is gone.
- In most cases, the instance is migrated to a new underlying host computer when it's started.
- The instance retains its private IPv4 addresses and any IPv6 addresses when stopped and started. AWS release the public IPv4 address and assign a new one when you start it.
- The instance retains its associated Elastic IP addresses.

#### Hibernate your instance -

- When you hibernate an instance, AWS signal the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk). Hibernation saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon EBS root volume. AWS persist the instance's Amazon EBS root volume and any attached Amazon EBS data volumes.
- You can hibernate an instance only if it's enabled for hibernation
- Root volume needs to be encrypted for hibernation.
- When you start your instance:
	- The Amazon EBS root volume is restored to its previous state
	- The RAM contents are reloaded

#### Reboot your instance -  

- An instance reboot is equivalent to an operating system reboot.  
- When you reboot an instance, it remains on the same physical host, so your instance keeps its public DNS name (IPv4), private IPv4 address, IPv6 address (if applicable), and any data on its instance store volumes.  
- AWS might schedule your instance for a reboot for necessary maintenance, such as to apply updates that require a reboot.  

#### Terminate your instance - 

- You can delete your instance when you no longer need it. This is referred to as terminating your instance. As soon as the state of an instance changes to shutting-down or terminated, you stop incurring charges for that instance.

#### Placement Groups -  

You can launch or start instances in a placement group, which determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware. When you create a placement group, you can create one of the following strategies for the group:

- Cluster - clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone  
- Partition - spreads instances across logical partitions, ensuring that instances in one partition do not share underlying hardware with instances in other partitions  
- Spread - spreads instances across distinct underlying hardware

﻿  
#### Security groups :

A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch, you can specify one or more security groups otherwise, AWS use the default security group.  

- You can add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances.  
- You can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group.  
- When AWS decide whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, AWS evaluate all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance.  
- When you launch an instance in a VPC, you must specify a security group that's created for that VPC.  
- Security group rules are always permissive; you can't create rules that deny access.  
- Security groups are stateful

#### Key Pairs : 

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public-key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, such as a password, then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair.  
To log in to your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the key pair when you launch the instance, and provide the private key when you connect to the instance.
