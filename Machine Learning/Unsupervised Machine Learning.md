# Unsupervised Learning:
- In Unsupervised learning, our job is to find something interesting in the unlabeled data.
- Unlike Supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms decide all by themselves how to group or cluster data together based on the given input etc.
- Data comes only with the input labels x, but not output labels y.
- Algorithm then, has to find structure or pattern or something interesting in the data.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:

### Clustering Algorithms:
- Group similar data points together.

> in the above image we are clustering tumors based on the give inputs of age and tumor size.

*Real life examples of clustering:*
- Google News: It goes through hundreds and thousands of articles daily and groups or clusters them in different clusters and this clustering is based on the article name, content ,etc.

- DNA Microarray clustering
- Grouping customers

### Anomaly  detection:
- Finding unusual data points in the given data set, e.g. Fraud detection in the financial system

### Dimensionality Reduction:
- Compress data using fewer numbers.
- This lets you take a big data set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data set while losing as little as information as possible.
