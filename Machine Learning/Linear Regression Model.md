# Linear Regression Model:

> The first model that we are going to see in the supervised machine learning is the *Linear Regression Model*.

1. Linear Regression Model consists of a data set that depends on the mathematical formula y=mx+c . Basically this model means fitting a straight line to our given data.
2. An apt example will be- Lets say we want to predict the price of the house by the size of the house.

3. Given above is the graph representing the data set. In the above data set y-axis denotes the prices of houses in $s and the x-axis denotes the size of the house in feet^2 .
4. To represent this data on a straight line , we have to first predict the value of the variables m and c in the formula y=mx+c and the value should be such that it best fits the given data.
5. The data that we will use to predict the value of of y here that represents the price of the house is the variable x that is the size of the house in feet^2. The variables m and c are only helping us here so that our cost function can predict the house prices with utmost accuracy.

> The Algorithm that we will be using to train our Linear Regression Model is called [[Gradient Descent Algorithm]] .
