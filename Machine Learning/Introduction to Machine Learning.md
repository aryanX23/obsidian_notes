# What is Machine learning?
- Field of Study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:

 ### Supervised Learning: 
 
- Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.
-  The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from.
-  That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output.
-  Example of how supervised learning algorithms are used in *real life scenarios*.
- Basically, Supervised learning learns from the data labeled with the *right answers*.

### Unsupervised Learning:
- In Unsupervised learning, our job is to find something interesting in the unlabeled data.
- Unlike Supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms decide all by themselves how to group or cluster data together based on the given input etc.
- Data comes only with the input labels x, but not output labels y.
- Algorithm then, has to find structure or pattern or something interesting in the data.
